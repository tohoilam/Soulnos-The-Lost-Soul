# Soulnos-The-Lost-Soul

## Overview

Soulnos – The Lost Soul is a 2D single-player platformer game, in which the player controls two characters - one in reality and one in the void, to clear every stage.

In the game, the player will face various challenges, including two kinds of monsters and four kinds of traps. As the movements of the two characters are synchronized, the player needs to control the characters smartly to avoid dangers in every stage. Both characters can make a melee attack to kill the monsters in the game.

In addition, four kinds of boosters may exist in each stage to assist the player in clearing the stage, including jump boost, speed boost, healing boost and ranged attack boost. To win the game, both characters need to reach the end door, and the player will lose if any one of the characters dies.
