# Soulnos: The Lost Soul

## Overview

Soulnos – The Lost Soul is a 2D single-player platformer game, in which the player controls two characters - one in reality and one in the void, to clear every stage.

In the game, the player will face various challenges, including two kinds of monsters and four kinds of traps. As the movements of the two characters are synchronized, the player needs to control the characters smartly to avoid dangers in every stage. Both characters can make a melee attack to kill the monsters in the game.

In addition, four kinds of boosters may exist in each stage to assist the player in clearing the stage, including jump boost, speed boost, healing boost and ranged attack boost. To win the game, both characters need to reach the end door, and the player will lose if any one of the characters dies.

### Game Rules

#### **Winning condition:**

Move both (sometimes four) characters into their corresponding goals to advance to the next stage.

#### **Losing condition:**

Any one of the characters dies or falls.

#### **Movement:**

Have to control both characters at the real and void sides simultaneously. Left, right movement, and jumping will apply to both characters. Real and void side characters’ gravity are in opposite directions.

#### **Attacks:**
Attack control will be applied to both characters at the real and void sides simultaneously. There are two attack modes, a fire attack (range), and a sword attack (melee). Characters can have a different attack mode at one single time. Press “Up key” to empower your next attack according to your attack mode. Each character and each attack mode has its own distinct cooldown.

## Master Mode:

Master mode has been added into the game purely for demonstration ONLY. It is NOT intended to be in the actual game. Enabling the master mode will unlock all the stages.
